# 👋 Hi, I'm Theofanis Nikolaou

## 💻 Junior Software Engineer | Aspiring Software Architect

🎓 **Computer Science student at the University of Western Macedonia (UOWM)**, graduating in 2025.  
I had the privilege to broaden my studies through an Erasmus+ program at Universidad de Castilla-La Mancha in Spain, where I focused on Computer Networks, Information Systems Audit, and VLSI Design.

I’m passionate about **software engineering**, **clean architecture**, and building scalable, user-focused applications. With over 20 certifications from top institutions like Harvard, AWS, and Cisco, I constantly explore new technologies and improve my craft through hands-on projects and hackathons.
